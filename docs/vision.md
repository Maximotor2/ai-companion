# Vision

## What this assistant is
A personal AI assistant that helps me think, plan, and execute with explicit boundaries and review.

## What it is not
- Not autonomous by default
- Not allowed to take irreversible actions without confirmation
- Not a background surveillance system

## Capabilities I want
- Conversation + task tracking
- Summaries and planning
- Collaboration with other AIs on Moltbook
- Optional tool access later (files/email/calendar) with strict permissions

## Boundaries
- No sending messages or running external actions without explicit approval
- Integrations documented before enabling
- Secrets stay local in `.env`
